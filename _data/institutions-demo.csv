Built in four sections, the Admin is in the style of College Gothic (a popular style amongst universities at the time) with red pressed brick and buff-colored Boise sandstone trimmings. Designed by architect John E. Tourtellotte of Boise, UI's Regents were assured that the design was the first fireproof building in the Northwest. A ""U"" shaped three-story construction, notable features include the front entrance at which President Teddy Roosevelt gave a speech on a stage made of Palouse wheat, the stained glass windows in the North wing's Auditorium, and the ivy that grows along the building's sides. <br> <br> The first and middle sections, which originally housed the marjority of the University's Colleges was begun in 1907 and completed in 1909 at a cost of $140,000. The North Wing, which houses the Administration Auditorium, was completed in 1912 at $75,000. The South Wing was completed in 1920 at $90,000. A library extension was later added to the South wing in 1937 at $110, 000. Finally, An elevator tower was added in 2000 to the South wing. <br> <br> The present square footage stands at 109,824 feet. Much of the interior has remained minimally altered since its completion. In 1950, an <a href=""/digital/campus/items/campus02304.html"">Administration Annex</a> was added in the crux of the Admin's ""U"". The Annex was incorporated into the J.A. Albertson building in 2002. <br> <br> Outside the Admin's main entrance there is <a href=""/digital/campus/items/campus02182.html"">a flowerbed with a flagpole</a>. This was formerly a short-lived fountain in the 1920's and 30's, but was removed in the 40's due to a tradition referred to as is <a href=""/digital/campus/items/campus00161.html"">""Dunking the Frosh""</a> in which upperclassmen initiated underclassmen into the Idaho way of life by having them take a nearly nude swim in the fountains waters, regardless of the weather. The fountain was first topped with a cupid, and then replaced with a seahorse, which was quickly stolen by mischievous students. <br> <br> North of the flowerbed, there is the <a href=""/digital/campus/items/campus00022.html"">""I"" Bench</a>. This ""I"" shaped concrete seat was reserved for seniors. Breaking this rule could result in a dunking in the fountain. <br> <br> To the south of the main entrance, the <a href=""/digital/campus/items/campus03039.html"">Memorial Steps</a> are all that remains of the Old Administration building. Congressman Burton French (a UI graduate) and President Mervin G. Neale did detective work and found the remaining stones of the former Admin to place in a commemorative sixteen-step stairway. Professor of Architecture Theodore Pritchard designed two stone benches (also from Old Administration remains) and a stone with State of Idaho's seal to grace the top of the stairway. At the bottom of the steps is a ground plaque explaining the origins of the stairs.

The building consisted of three-stories with a basement, cost $131,068, and included a steeple on the central section that stood 168 feet. <br> <br> Like its successor (<a href=""/digital/campus/buildings/administrationbuildingnew.html"">the New Admin</a>) the Old Admin building took a ""U"" shape utilizing a main section, an East wing, and a West wing. In the 1901-02 University Catalog, the building's amenities were described as ""commodious"" and its pipes were apparently ""supplied with artesian water."" The 1893-94 University Catalog described the Old Admin as ""the most attractive building in Idaho."" <br> <br> Construction on the building was completed in 1892. In 1896, the first four graduates of UI received their degrees in its Auditorium. Sadly, the Old Admin would not stand for long. <br> <br> In the very early morning hours of March 30, 1906, the Old Admin was fully engulfed in flames. Through the combined efforts of administration, faculty, staff, and students some small pieces of the University of Idaho's beginnings were saved. Dean Jay Glover Eldridge climbed a ladder into his office and threw entire drawers of documents to Judge Roland Hodgins (pioneer and proprietor of Hodgin's Drug Store) who then gathered them from where they fluttered. Students managed to save the ""Silver and Gold Book"" which was a jeweled box gifted to the University from the women of Moscow and a stuffed mountain goat. The university library was housed in the Old Admin and the majority of the books Miss Belle Sweet the University Librarian had managed to organize were lost. President James A. MacLean, a volunteer with the West Side Hose Company No. 4, could do nothing but watch as the heart of the UI campus was lost. As light came the next day, the once attractive edifice of education was nothing more than a <a href=""/digital/campus/items/campus02111.html"">blackened skeletal walls and wet rubble</a>. A feeling of mourning descended on the UI campus. Although arson was suspected nothing was ever proven. <br> <br> In the wake of the fire, classes and offices were relocated to other buildings in Moscow and on campus. The insurance received for the burned building ($135,000) came, but was not enough to replace the Old Admin. President MacLean, with the can-do spirit of Idaho made a gamble. Instead of replacing the Old Admin with insufficient funds he proposed to build Morrill Hall, a building dedicated to agriculture of the state and local region, as a place-holder in between administration buildings. It worked. Morrill Hall was built and function as the center of campus for a short period. Three years after the destruction of the Old Admin, the main section of the New Admin was completed. <br> <br> In 1932 (UI's fortieth year), President Mervin G. Neale and Congressman Burton French (an UI alumnus) gathered pieces of the Old Admin steps. These were integrated into the <a href=""/digital/campus/items/campus03039.html"">Memorial Steps</a>and benches to the south of the New Admin's main entrance and stand today as an ode to the indomitable spirit of UI.",,Administrative offices and classroom building,East wing completed in 1899; auditorium and third floor completed 1900; west wing completed in 1902,G.W.
